# Advent of Code 2021

Check the [Advent of Code site](https://adventofcode.com/) for details

I don't know how many days I will be able to participate, but let's give it a shot.

Doing it in Rust. Run each day as `cargo run -- <<dayN>> <<params>>` where N is from 1 to 25.
For part 2 in a day it will typically be `dayN-2`.
If I didn't get to do one of the days, it will complain. Just `cargo run` to see the days
available (they show in the help as SUBCOMMANDS). E.g.

```
cargo run -- day1 data/day1.txt
```

Note: the event creators requested that data files for the problems are not posted in public.
See [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/k99rod/sharing_input_data_were_we_requested_not_to/gf2ukkf/) for details.
So you need to get your own copy of these files from the AoC site if you want to run my solutions.
