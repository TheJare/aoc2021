# Advent of Code 2021

Check the [Advent of Code site](https://adventofcode.com/) for details

I don't know how many days I will be able to participate, but let's give it a shot.

Doing it in Rust. Run each day as `cargo run -- <<dayN>> <<params>>` where N is from 1 to 25.
If I didn't get to do one of the days, it will complain. Just `cargo run` to see the days
available (they show in the help as SUBCOMMANDS).
